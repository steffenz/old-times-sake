# old-times-sake

This fantasticly simple application does one thing, and one thing only. It fetches the news every week, and delays presenting them to you. It hopefully helps you break free of that horrible scrolling and soul itching anxiety it is to stay "updated". As someone who always strived to be well-informed it has proven, I've recently woken up and realized how terrible it makes me feel. The world is seriously a messed up place, and click-generating has turned batshit crazy.

As an initial MVP, and for my usage anyway, this application the latest RSS from NRK (Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation) once a week. As this is still under development an actual dump is included in the repository for testing purposes. This will be replaced and proper credit the provider (NRK in this case) will be given (with link to the articles themselves).
Information about their RSS feeds can be found [here](https://www.nrk.no/rss/)
